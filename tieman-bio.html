    I am Rachel Tieman and I am a junior advertising student at the S.I. Newhouse School of Communications at Syracuse University, I am also pursuing a minor in Information Management and Technology. I am interested into getting into the creative direction of advertising. Outside of work, I love to read, shop, and travel (London, Amsterdam, and Rome are my favorite cities). I come from a very close family and friends are extremely important to me. I am very outgoing and always down to go on an adventure.
